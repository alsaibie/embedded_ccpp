# Introduction to Embedded C/C++

<!-- \tableofcontents -->

This is a stand-alone mini course that covers introductory concepts of Embedded C/C++. It is currently presented primarily for [ME 319 Mechatronics](https://alsaibie.github.io/me319)

# Prerequisites
The course assumes basic working knowledge of a programming language.

## Class Lectures

The course will start by covering the fundamentals of C/C++ in detail in [Part I](part_i/introduction/index.html). 

Since this course is tailored toward embedded robotic, mechatronic and control systems, example uses of C/C++ will be given for a number of embedded applications, such as threading, event-programming, state-machine, and digital filtering in **Part II**

In **Part III**, we will touch on a few basic optimization tips in C/C++. This is a field of study on its own but we will only highlight common cases to encourage the consideration of the subject.

Then, we will introduce in **Part IV** the Arduino framework, written in C/C++, given its popularity as a framework for programming microcontrollers.

<!-- Finally, we will introduce the Robot-Operation-System framework (ROS), which is an increasingly popular framework written primarily in C++ and Python.  -->

Before we start, remember that the best way to learn is to try and experiment. Do not be intimidated by the amount of material covered in this course. You can start to program with just a few pieces of information and you can always go back to the material, or search the resources to know and understand more. Knowledge in programming is gained through experience. 

This course is not meant to be an exhaustive reference, but only a beginner's launchpad. 

Lecture notes and videos can be found listed on the site navigation bar.
