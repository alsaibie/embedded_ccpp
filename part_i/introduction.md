## Part I - Fundamentals

The following are the topics that will be covered in **Part I** of this course. The way the course is structured is geared toward *C* more so than *C++*. This is due to the fact that when working with microcontrollers, more of the lower-level programming aspects become important. 

If we were teaching C++ for desktop applications, the structure and flow of a C++ course would be different, especially with [Modern C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk)

These topics are not of equal weight. For example, the topic of classes in C++ is a large anc complex topic and computing concept, it is a course on its own. It will not be covered in detail; however, knowledge of bassic class structures is important when working with the Arduino framework for instance, where most of the libraries available use OOP (object-oriented programming).
