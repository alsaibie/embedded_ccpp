The following are the topics that will be covered in **Part I** of this course. The way the course is structured is geared toward *C* concepts more so than *C++* concepts. This is due to the fact that when working with microcontrollers, more of the lower-level programming aspects become important. However; the examples are provided and compiled as C++.

If we were teaching C++ for desktop applications, the structure and flow of a C++ course would be different, especially with [Modern C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk)

These topics are not of equal weight. For example, the topic of classes in C++ is a large anc complex topic and computing concept, it is a course on its own. It will not be covered in detail; however, knowledge of basic class structures is important when working with the Arduino framework for instance, where most of the libraries available use OOP (object-oriented programming).

## How to navigate the course
While it is possible to introduce independent concepts sequentially that build on one another, soon the concepts become inter-related when building a complete program, which requires that you have a good understanding of all the fundamentals to comprehend the full picture. So try to have a long deep session reviews all fundamentals lessons, then go back and forth between the concepts that are unclear and try to practice them.
